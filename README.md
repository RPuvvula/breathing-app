## üöÄ Getting Started: Local Development

This project is configured to run directly in the browser without any build steps or package installation.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or another code editor.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/breathing-app.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd breathing-app
    ```

3.  **Run the app with Vite's dev server:**
    This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to handle TypeScript and React modules.

    - If you haven't already, install dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - Start the development server:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
    - Open the local URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

> **Note:**  
> The VS Code "Live Server" extension will not work for this project because it does not compile TypeScript or JSX files. Always use Vite's dev server

The application will open in your default browser, and the page will automatically reload whenever you save a file.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Notice

This breathing method is powerful and should be practiced with caution.

- **NEVER** practice in or near water (e.g., shower, bath, pool, ocean). Fainting during the breath-hold is a risk and is extremely dangerous in water.
- **NEVER** practice while driving a vehicle or operating machinery.
- If you are pregnant, have epilepsy, high blood pressure, or a history of serious health conditions like heart disease, **DO NOT** practice without consulting a medical professional first.
- Always listen to your body. Light-headedness can be normal, but if you feel sharp pain or extreme discomfort, stop the practice immediately.
