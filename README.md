## üöÄ Getting Started: Local Development

This project is configured to run directly in the browser without any build steps or package installation.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or another code editor.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/breathing-app.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd breathing-app
    ```

3.  **Run the app with Vite's dev server:**
    This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to handle TypeScript and React modules.

    - If you haven't already, install dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - Start the development server:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
    - Open the local URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

> **Note:**  
> The VS Code "Live Server" extension will not work for this project because it does not compile TypeScript or JSX files. Always use Vite's dev server

The application will open in your default browser, and the page will automatically reload whenever you save a file.

## üåê Deploying to GitHub Pages

You can publish this app to GitHub Pages for free static hosting. Follow these steps:

### 1. Configure the Repository

- Ensure your repository is **public** on GitHub.
- In your `package.json`, add a `homepage` field (replace with your actual username and repo name):

  ```json
  "homepage": "https://your-username.github.io/breathing-app"
  ```

- Your `vite.config.ts` should already have the correct base:
  ```ts
  base: '/breathing-app/',
  ```

### 2. Update Asset Paths (if needed)

- In `index.html`, change any absolute asset paths (e.g., `/index.css`) to relative paths (e.g., `index.css`) so assets load correctly on GitHub Pages.

### 3. Install gh-pages

Install the `gh-pages` package as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

### 4. Add Deploy Scripts

Add these scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

### 5. Deploy to GitHub Pages

Run the following command to build and publish your app:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will push the contents of the `dist` folder to a `gh-pages` branch on your repository.

### 6. Enable GitHub Pages

- Go to your repository on GitHub.
- Click **Settings** > **Pages**.
- Under "Source", select the `gh-pages` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
- Save.

Your app will be available at:  
`https://your-username.github.io/breathing-app/`

---

### üö© After the First Build

- For future updates, simply run `npm run deploy` again after making changes.
- No need to repeat the setup steps; just commit your changes and redeploy.

---

**Note:**

- If you change your repo name or username, update the `homepage` and `base` fields accordingly.
- If you see a blank page after deployment, double-check that all asset paths in `index.html` are relative and that the `base` is set correctly in

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Notice

This breathing method is powerful and should be practiced with caution.

- **NEVER** practice in or near water (e.g., shower, bath, pool, ocean). Fainting during the breath-hold is a risk and is extremely dangerous in water.
- **NEVER** practice while driving a vehicle or operating machinery.
- If you are pregnant, have epilepsy, high blood pressure, or a history of serious health conditions like heart disease, **DO NOT** practice without consulting a medical professional first.
- Always listen to your body. Light-headedness can be normal, but if you feel sharp pain or extreme discomfort, stop the practice immediately.
